# Statistical Analysis: Fly Wing Ratio

This repository contains an R Markdown notebook performing a statistical analysis of fly wing ratio data from the `Sleuth2` dataset (`ex0918`).

The analysis focuses on exploring the relationship between the ratio of average basal wing length and wing size in female *Drosophila subobscura* flies and various predictors, including continent of origin and wing size.

Key steps covered in the analysis include:

*   Basic statistical exploration and data visualization.
*   Linear regression modeling with numerical and categorical predictors.
*   Model selection using statistical tests and information criteria (AIC/BIC).
*   Verification of linear model assumptions (autocorrelation, normality, homoscedasticity).


**The analysis and commentary within the R Markdown notebook are written in Czech.**

**Libraries:** `Sleuth2`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `car`, `lmtest`, `olsrr`, etc.
